## Markets

The lending platform offers isolated markets where users can deposit collateral and borrow mUSD. Collateral accepted on the platform are ERC20 tokens, which can be deposited and held as collateral by users. The principal amount of mUSD that a user can borrow depends on the value of the deposited collateral.

### Collateral

Users can deposit ERC20 tokens as collateral for their loans. The platform currently supports a wide range of ERC20 tokens, and users can view the list of supported tokens on the platform. The collateral ratio is the ratio between the value of the collateral deposited and the value of the loan that a user can borrow. The higher the collateral ratio, the lower the risk of liquidation. The collateral ratio may vary across markets, as the maximum loan to value parameters are determined by the market administrators based on the token risk assessment.

### Principal

The principal amount in mUSD a user can borrow depends on the value of the deposited collateral. The maximum amount of mUSD that can be borrowed is calculated based on the Loan to Value ratio and the value of the deposited collateral. The platform allows users to borrow up to a certain percentage of the collateral value, as defined by the maximum loan to value parameters of the market.

### Maximum Loan to Value

The maximum loan to value defines the maximum percentage of the collateral value that a user can borrow. These parameters are determined by the market administrators based on the token risk assessment. The higher the risk associated with a particular token, the lower the maximum loan to value ratio for that token. For this reason, it may vary across markets.

### Interest Rate

Interest is charged on the borrowed principal and is paid by the borrower to the market administrators. The interest rate is set by the market administrators and can vary between different markets. The interest rate is calculated as an annual percentage rate (APR) and is applied to the outstanding principal balance.
